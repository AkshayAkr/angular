## Build Setup
I am using json server for database .
Kindly run json-server --watch db.json in command prompt

Without starting json server the application will not start.



This is important . Please do the following things.
In command prompt
npm install
json-server --watch db.json(in first terminal)

Kindly refer to db.json in the project.
